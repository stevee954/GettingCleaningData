The data for this assignment was, I think, needlessly technical.   The main goal is to learn how to apply the R tools. I spent too much time trying to understand the data well enough to begin to piece it together.  Does anybody else feel this way?  The same proficiency in R could have been shown using a generic dataset like MtCars.  Anyway, I guess the struggle makes you better.


The dataset include Test and Taining files with n-rows and 560 measures, not labeled.  The subject and activity files had the same number of rows as the data, so it was apparent they both could be bound to the data.

The overall task was to bind the data, extract the necessary subset, convert integers to factors, label the factors appropriately, and then compress the data using MELT.  From there the final tidy dataset was achieved with one line using DCAST.
